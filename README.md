# Directory-ReNameTool
### This is an updated version of my original rename tool but with much less hassle!</h3>
This tool allows for renaming a whole directory with ease. You can customize how basic or complicated you want your renaming pattern.

## Documentation
The script does not rename itself, so you don't have to worry about the name of the script changing after the renaming.

**BEFORE RUNNING THE TOOL** make sure to have Python 3 installed on your system. The exact version number doesn't matters as long as it's Python 3.

**THE SCOPE** of the script is the directory the script is in. The script doesn't go any deeper into the directories. 

**Instructions:**
1. Place the script in the directory you want the script to have access to.
2. Run the script.
3. The first prompt will ask if you want advanced naming scheme, meaning a seperate name for each file type, or a general name that is common across all file types.
  * If you enter Y, the script will use ONE name across all file types. 
  * If you enter N, the script will ask for a different name for each file type.
4. The script will ask what number to start from. For example if you want the script to start renaming from IMG52 and continue to 53 and up, you would put "IMG" for the name prompt and "52" for the starting number prompt.
