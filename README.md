# Directory-ReNameTool
### This is an updated version of my original rename tool but with much less hassle!</h3>
This tool allows for renaming a whole directory with ease. You can customize how basic or complicated you want your renaming pattern.

## Documentation

**BEFORE RUNNING THE TOOL** make sure to have Python 3 installed on your system. The exact version number doesn't matters as long as it's Python 3.

**THE SCOPE** of the script is the directory the script is in. The script doesn't go any deeper into the directories. 

**Instructions:**
1. PLACEHOLDER
2. Run the script. <br>
3. input the requested info.<br>
4. BAM!
